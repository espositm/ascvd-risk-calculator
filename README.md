This was forked strictly to test out a SMART on FHIR app and see how it works.

# ASCVD Risk App #

ASCVD Risk App is a web application built using React, ES2015, SMART, and FHIR technologies.

The ASCVD Risk Calculator is a tool intended to help users find an estimate for their cardiovascular risk according to
the [2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk][1] and the [2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment
of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults][2]. Specifically, this tool allows users
to estimate a 10-year and/or lifetime risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). These scores are estimated
based on the Pooled Cohort Equations and lifetime risk prediction tools. 

The tool also has the ability to simulate a potential reduction in risk based on the risk factors taken into account 
to calculate the score. This allows a user to see how one or several actions could help to reduce their risk of ASCVD.
Along with this, the tool calculates a lowest possible risk score determined by lowest possible values for the labs
taken into account to calculate risk, and considering the user is not currently a diabetic, is not smoking, and is not
taking treatment for hypertension.

This tool is intended for those with an assumed LDL - Cholesterol < 190 mg/dL, and
the following are a number of factors required to calculate an estimated ASCVD risk:
- Sex
- Age
- Race
- Total Cholesterol
- HDL - Cholesterol
- Systolic Blood Pressure
- Diabetes status
- Current Smoking status
- Treatment for Hypertension status

The risk scores calculated by this tool and
any recommendations provided are intended to inform, and should not supersede any findings or opinions by a care provider.

## 10-Year ASCVD Risk ##

The 10-year risk estimate provided by this application is primarily applicable towards African-American and 
non-Hispanic white men and women between the ages of 40 and 79 years. Other ethnic groups will have their score
calculated with the same equation for non-Hispanic white men and women, though the score estimated 
may underestimate or overestimate the risk for these persons.

## Lifetime ASCVD Risk ##

The lifetime risk estimate provided by this application is primarily applicable towards non-Hispanic white men and
women between the ages of 20 and 59 years. The score calculated will be under the impression of a 50-year old
without ASCVD with the relevant factors entered in this calculator by the user. Similar to the 10-year risk estimate, 
other ethnic groups will have their score calculated with the same equation for non-Hispanic white men and women, 
though the score estimated may underestimate or overestimate the risk for these persons.

# Running Locally #

This project uses the [webpack-dev-server][3] to run the application locally.
In order to test reflected changes from editing any code locally off the ```app```, ```components```,
or ```views``` folders, there are a few steps to configure the project:

1. Install [NPM][4] and install/update [Node][5]
2. Run ```npm install``` to install all dependencies onto the project
3. Run ```npm start``` to start the server on port 8080 of localhost
4. Using a patient from the smarthealthit open FHIR DSTU2 endpoint, 
launch with this link: ```localhost:8080/launch.html?fhirServiceUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ffhir-open-api-dstu2.smarthealthit.org&patientId=1768562```
 
# Build #

This project uses webpack to build the application and will generate a ```bundle.js``` and ```styles.css``` file 
inside the ```build/``` directory that includes the necessary dependencies and core application code.

To create the build files, run the command: ```npm run build``` in the
root directory of this project. These files are referenced in the HTML file ```index.html```. The ```build/``` folder in the 
project acts as the final version of these files to be used in production.

# App Development and Project Structure #

The following tree closely aligns with Hierarchy of the React Components.
```
Entry
|--ErrorContainer
`--App
   |--Header
   |--Navbar
   |--PatientBanner
   |--Recommendations
   |  `--DetailBox
   |--Form
   |  |--ButtonForm
   |  |--InputTextForm
   |  |--RadioButtonForm
   |  `--SendForm
   `--Results
      |--Graph
      |  `--GraphBar
      `--SimulatedRisk
         `--RiskAction
```
When making changes locally, first make changes at the component level located in ```components/``` and ```views/``` 
or the ASCVDRisk model located at ```app/load_fhir_data.js```. The three main views of this project are:
- Results: Form page (initial view)
- Risk Factors: Graph and Simulated Risk sections
- Recommendations: Detailed recommendation boxes

The central state of the React application is in the ```/components/App/app.jsx``` file. This
also includes handling navigation throughout the application.

When changes are verified locally, run the build (see Build section above) to bundle all changes
made.

# Testing and Linting #

This project uses the [Jest][6] testing framework for unit testing React components, and the 
[Mocha][7] testing framework for unit testing the ASCVDRisk object model. Tests are available
under the ```tests/``` folder in the root of the project directory.
 
Run the following command to run all unit tests: ```npm test``` 

This project uses the [ESLint][8] tool to lint all application-facing ES6 Javascript and JSX files using
the Airbnb [JavaScript Style Guide][9]. The configuration for this tool is found in the root of
the project directory in the ```.eslintrc``` file.

Run the following command to lint the project: ```npm run lint```
